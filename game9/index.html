</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
	<li> Each player starts with 20 health points. Every three rounds the player order alternates. On a player's turn, he can either click the bottom deck which picks a random card of any element or click one of the top decks which choose  a random card of a specific element (Which gives him better chances of getting card he wants). If he chooses the top deck, he won't be able choose from it for 3 rounds (So choose wisely). After both players choose a card, the results are determined based on card action and element combination. Note: Fire weakens Air, Air weakens Earth, Earth weakens Water, and Water weakens Fire. The first player with 0 health loses. (What was added) Players can now choose subelements such as lightning, projection, metal, and ice. There is also a time limit of 5 secs for each turn</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
	<li> If a player has the last turn in a round, he should use the top deck wisely to choose a stronger element to weaken other player's card action (attack,defense,heal) by half
		Ex. If P1 picks Air, P2 should pick Fire (HINT: Stronger element is to the left of weaker element in card deck order)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
	<li> This game is set in a world where there are only four elements of fire, water, air, and earth. Each player can wield all four elements and are constantly at battle. The winner of the battles determines who is the best wielder of all four elements</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
	<li> This game reaches the strategic card gamers looking to be competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>

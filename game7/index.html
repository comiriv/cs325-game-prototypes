<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
	<li> The player will receive a roll at the beginning of their turn that says how many spaces they can move. Pressing the SPACE button will move them in a clockwise faction till their roll is 0. Along the way, if they pass a plane, bus, or train station, they can press ENTER to use the station provided that it has been unused and they can afford it (Bus - 100, Train - 150, Plane - 200). If the player lands on a nontrain station, they will receive the reward or consequence of that space (Either money or they get robbed). After that the next player's turn starts with his roll. This process continues for 15 rounds or until all the plane and bus stations are used up.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
	<li> It is good to save up money as you need it to use the stations. Try to prioritize plane spaces over train and bus stations as they will yield more souveneirs but also cost more</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
	<li> This game is set in the United States. Each player is trying to collect souvneirs before they die in 6 months. There are obstacles like areas where players can lose souveneirs and competition for getting souvenirs first. The players who get the most souveneirs will have accomplished their goal and the others will fail</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
	<li> This game reaches the strategic gamers who like to play board games</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul>
	<li> It takes around 5 to 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>

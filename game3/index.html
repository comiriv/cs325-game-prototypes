</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?

	<li> The hardest part was the layer system and random number array</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
